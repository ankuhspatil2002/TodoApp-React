## How it Works


### Dark/Light Mode
- The app uses CSS variables to define colors for dark and light themes. When you toggle the mode, the styles change accordingly.

### Adding Todos
- You can type a new todo in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.

### Deleting Todos
- Each todo item has a delete button that removes it from the list. You can also clear all todos with the "Remove All" button.

### Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS: For styling the app.
- UUID: For generating unique IDs for each todo item.
